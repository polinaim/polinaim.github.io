abstract: The dynamics of the nervous system are characterized by the intricate interactions
  among precisely arranged multiscale neural networks, arising from the innate capacity of the system for         self-organization and adaptation to regulatory cues from the microenvironment. However, the fundamental     principles governing organization and function of neural networks remain largely unknown. In recent years, in   vitro engineered interfaces have emerged as a viable approach to study neural networks at the mesoscale,   providing a highly controlled microenvironment and allowing to mimic key aspects of in vivo neural networks,   while minimizing the associated complexities by adopting a reductionist approach. In this M.Sc thesis, we used   novel models for in vitro neural culturing to recapitulate significant aspects from in vivo topology and   manipulate the structure-function dynamics within populations of neurons. To attain modular organization of   segregated neuronal populations we used novel multi-nodal microfluidic devices, featuring afferent-efferent   connectivity promoted via Tesla-valve inspired microchannels. The presence of structural modularity and   unidirectionality was validated by employing viral tools for cellular delivery of genes for expressing distinct   fluorescent proteins within the segregated neural population in two-nodal microfluidics. To capture their   functional dynamics, we implemented and optimized a system for optogenetics and calcium imaging. Furthermore, we   demonstrate that altering the number of microchannels within a five-nodal microfluidic coupled with   microelectrode array can influence inter-nodal connectivity. We then selectively perturbed one node within the   five-nodal microfluidic and showed notable alternations in functional connectivity among the nodes, as well as   in firing rates within each node. Finally, we tested the biocompatibility of novel 3D microfabricated     interfaces with neuronal cultures, aiming to facilitate the formation of tridimensional neural networks while   retaining the simplicity of handling neural cultures. This work highlights the immense potential of advanced   neuroengineered in vitro models to recapitulate microscale topological organization of neural networks and   investigate their structure-function dynamics in healthy and perturbed conditions.
